0. This command was not running
	python -m api.v1.app 

1. Look my square, it’s perfect? No? Should I change something?

2. I just start my OOP project and nothing works…

3. I finished and deployed my Rails blog but people are contacting me because they can’t access any of my blog posts… Weird, it works for me…
	I would like to add a boolean online for each Post object with a default value true. With this boolean, I will be able to hide/show some blog posts from the listing. I will also need a way to change this boolean in the Post#edit route. Could you do this for me?

4. Ok, let’s jump on it and fix it! The broken website
	Arf, I have also the pagination to fix… I didn’t have time before my break to look at it…
